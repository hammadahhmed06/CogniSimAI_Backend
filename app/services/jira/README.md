- âœ… Advanced JQL search capabilities
- âœ… Issue history tracking
- âœ… Rate limiting and error handling
- âœ… Encrypted credential support

### 2. Real-time Webhook Handler (`app/services/jira/jira_webhook_handler.py`)
**Comprehensive Event Processing:**
- âœ… Issue events (created, updated, deleted)
- âœ… Comment events (created, updated, deleted)
- âœ… Worklog events (created, updated, deleted)
- âœ… Project events (created, updated, deleted)
- âœ… Sprint events (created, updated, closed, started)
- âœ… Real-time sync callbacks
- âœ… Webhook signature validation
- âœ… Event type mapping and processing
- âœ… Error handling and logging

### 3. Enhanced Sync Service (`app/services/jira/enhanced_jira_sync_service.py`)
**Advanced Synchronization:**
- âœ… Bi-directional data synchronization
- âœ… Real-time webhook integration
- âœ… Bulk operations support
- âœ… Sync status monitoring
- âœ… Force sync capabilities
- âœ… Integration management
- âœ… Error tracking and reporting
- âœ… Background sync processes

### 4. Complete API Endpoints (`app/api/routes/integrations.py`)
**Enhanced Endpoints Added:**
- âœ… `POST /jira/webhook` - Real-time webhook processing
- âœ… `POST /jira/{integration_id}/issues` - Create issues
- âœ… `PUT /jira/{integration_id}/issues/{issue_key}` - Update issues
- âœ… `POST /jira/{integration_id}/issues/bulk` - Bulk create issues
- âœ… `GET /jira/{integration_id}/search` - JQL search
- âœ… `GET /jira/{integration_id}/sync/status` - Sync status
- âœ… `POST /jira/{integration_id}/sync` - Manual sync trigger
- âœ… `GET /jira/sync/status/all` - All integration statuses
